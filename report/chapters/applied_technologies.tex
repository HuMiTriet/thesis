\chapter{\centering Applied Technologies}

Overall the technologies used in the internship's project can be divided into
three categorizes: Prototyping, Testing, and Data visualization

\section{Prototyping}

\subsection{Distributed System}


\subsection{Python}
Python is a high level interpreted language, it is dynamically-typed, and garbage-collected.
The reason for python being chosen because it eases of development stemming from 
python easy to read syntax and conciseness. Also, because there are state-of-the-art
testing frameworks such as hypothesis and other data visualization such as Matplotlib
that is widely used and documented make python the most well suited option for 
this project.

% \subsection{JSON}

\subsection{HTTP}
Since the scope of the internship investigation is about HTTP communication and to mimic 
most closely to real life production scenario HTTP is chosen as the main communication 
protocol between the nodes in the system, more specifically we will be using HTTP/2 with 
TCP as the transport layer.

HTTP functions in a request response manner to the in the client-server model, 
in which a client will make a request to the server and awaits for a response 
from the server, all participants can include in their request or response 
an optional payload which in this project is encoded in the JSON format.

\subsection{Flask}

\section{Testing}

\subsection{pytest}

\subsection{hypothesis}
