The Network Security, Information Security, and Data Protection Research Group 
operates under the astute leadership of Prof. Dr. Kappes. The group's principal 
focus is on the research and development of advanced network security solutions 
for future generations. In addition to theoretical research, the group also offers
practical solutions to third parties, including private companies and governmental agencies.

During this research period, I have the privilege of working under the supervision 
of Lukas Atkinson (M.Sc.), with additional support from Prof. Dr. Kappes. Our 
collaboration is entirely virtual, involving 2-3 meetings per week to discuss 
current progress and to exchange ideas and guidance
