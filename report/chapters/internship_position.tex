\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{research_group_logo.png} \\

I completed my internship at The Research Group for Network Security at\\
Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences.\\ 

Overall, my work during the internship period can be divided into roughly three phases:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Prototyping Phase: A prototype of a distributed system communicating via HTTP 
    is built.
  \item Fault Injection and Fuzzy Testing Phase: A method of fault injection and fuzzy testing is developed
    to test the aforementioned system.
  \item Data Collection and Statistical Analysis: Data resulted from the testing of the system is gathered
    and compiled to create statistical analysis of the system.
\end{itemize}


During this research period, I have the privilege of working under the supervision 
of Lukas Atkinson (M.Sc.), with additional support from Prof. Dr. Kappes. Our 
collaboration is entirely virtual, involving 2-3 meetings per week to discuss 
current progress and to exchange ideas and guidance.
