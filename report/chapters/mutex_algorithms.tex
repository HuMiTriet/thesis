\section{Token Ring}
Token ring initially is a computer networking technology introduced by IBM 
to build local area network \cite{wiki_token_ring}. The token ring can be used 
to describe the physical or logical topology, in this specific project since 
the nodes are all just different process running on local host, the term will be
used to describe the logical topology.

The token ring algorithm is the simplest conceptually of the three since it works 
by first arranging the node in a circular ring and then a random node is given a 
token. This token is continuously pass around the ring in one direction as shown in
\ref{fig:token_ring_top}
